# Directed Spectrum #
This simple package provides code for estimating the directed spectrum, a measure of directed communication between timeseries.
A primary use case of the directed spectrum is the estimation of latent brain networks from recordings of neural activity.
To do so, use the `ds` function provided in this package to estimate directed spectrum values for your data, then apply a linear factor model, such as non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), to estimate latent networks from the data: 
```python
from dir_spec.ds import ds
from sklearn.decomposition import NMF

directed_spectrum = ds(neural_data, sampling_frequency, channel_names)

# format ds array for NMF
X = directed_spectrum.ds_array
X = X.reshape((X.shape[0], -1))

network_model = NMF(50, solver='mu', beta_loss=0, init='nndsvdar')
network_activations = network_model.fit_transform(X)
latent_networks = network_model.components_
```
The directed spectrum is compatible with the underlying assumptions of linear latent factor models for identifying latent brain networks from neural recordings, unlike other measures of directed communication (*eg* Granger causality).
These properties of the directed spectrum also extend to other applications where the goal is latent network discovery, as long as the medium through which the signal is recorded does not cause nonlinear distortions relative to the underlying signal generated by the unobserved networks.
The `ds` function within the `ds` module takes 2 required parameters, in addition to several optional parameters, and returns an object of the `DirectedSpectrum` class.

## Use ##
This package has one public function: `ds`
```python
ds(X, f_samp, groups=None, pairwise=False, f_res=None,
       return_onesided=False, estimator='Wilson',
       order='aic', max_ord=50, ord_est_epochs=30,
       max_iter=1000, tol=1e-6, window='hann', nperseg=None, noverlap=None):
```
##### Parameters #####
* `X` : numpy.ndarray, shape (n_windows, n_channels, n_timepoints)  
        Timeseries data from multiple channels. It is assumed that the
        data for each channel are approximately stationary within a window.
        If a 2-D array is input, it is assumed that n_windows is 1.
* `f_samp` : float  
        Sampling rate associated with X.
* `groups` : list of strings, shape (n_channels), optional  
        To calculate the Directed Spectrum between groups of channels, this
        should list the group associated with each channel. Otherwise, to
        calculate the directed spectrum between each pair of channels, this
        should be a list of channel names. If 'None' (default), then each
        channel will be given a unique integer index.
* `pairwise` : bool, optional  
        If 'True', calculate the pairwise directed spectrum
        (i.e. calculate seperately for each pair of groups/channels).
        Otherwise, the non-pairwise directed spectrum will be calculated.
        Note the pairwise directed spectrum is not defined for elements
        where the source and target are the same.
* `f_res` : float, optional  
        Frequency resolution of the calculated spectrum. For example, if
        set to 1, then the directed spectrum will be calculated for
        integer frequency values. If set to 'None' (default), then
        the frequency resolution will be f_samp/nperseg if estimator is
        'Wilson' or f_samp/order if estimator is 'AR' and pairwise is
        False. f_res must be set if estimator is 'AR' and pairwise is
        True.
* `return_onesided` : bool, optional  
        If True, return a one-sided spectrum. If False return a
        two-sided spectrum. Must be False if the input timeseries is
        complex. Defaults to False.
* `estimator` : {'Wilson', 'AR'}, optional  
        Method to use for estimating the directed spectrum. 'Wilson' is
        Wilson's spectral factorization of the data cross-spectral
        density matrix. 'AR' fits an autoregressive model to the data.
        Defaults to 'Wilson'.
* `order` : int or 'aic', optional  
        Autoregressive model order. If 'aic', used Akaike Information
        Criterion to automatically determine model order. Used only when
        estimator is 'AR'. Defaults to 'aic'.
* `max_ord` : int, optional
        Maximum autoregressive model order. Only used when estimator is
        'AR' and order is 'aic'. Default is 50.
* `ord_est_epochs` : int, optional
        Number of epochs to sample from full dataset for estimating
        model order. Only used when estimator is 'AR' and order is
        'aic'. The highest AIC value from all sampled epochs is used
        to select the model order. Default is 20.
* `max_iter` : int, optional  
        Max number of Wilson factorization iterations. If factorization
        does not converge before reaching this value, directed spectrum
        estimates may be inaccurate. Used only when estimator is
        'Wilson'. No Defaults to 1000.
* `tol` : float, optional  
        Wilson factorization convergence tolerance value. Used only when
        estimator is 'Wilson'. Defaults to 1e-6.
* `window` : str or tuple or array_like, optional  
        Desired window to use. If `window` is a string or tuple, it is
        passed to `get_window` to generate the window values, which are
        DFT-even by default. See `get_window` for a list of windows and
        required parameters. If `window` is array_like it will be used
        directly as the window and its length must be nperseg. Defaults
        to a Hann window.
* `nperseg` : int, optional  
        Length of each segment. Defaults to None, but if window is str or
        tuple, is set to 256, and if window is array_like, is set to the
        length of the window.
* `noverlap`: int, optional  
        Number of points to overlap between segments. If `None`,
        ``noverlap = nperseg // 2``. Defaults to `None`.
 
 *[Documentation for the `window`, `nperseg`, and `noverlap` variables was
        copied directly from the scipy.signal.spectral module. These
        variables are used for calculating the cross power spectral density
        matrix as an intermediate step in calculating the directed spectrum 
        when estimator is 'Wilson' or to calculate power spectral density
        when estimator is 'AR' and pairwise is True, and are not used
        otherwise.]*


`ds` returns a `DirectedSpectrum` object.
```python
DirectedSpectrum(ds_array, f, cgroups)
```
##### Attributes #####
* `ds_array` : ndarray, shape (n_windows, n_frequencies, n_groups, n_groups)  
        Directed spectrum values between each pair of channels/groups 
        for each frequency and window. Axis 2 corresponds to the source 
        channel/group and axis 3 corresponds to the target 
        channel/group. For 'full' models, elements for which the target 
        and source are the same correspond to the self-directed 
        spectrum, representing all signal in that region that is not 
        explained by any of the other sources in the model. For pairwise 
        directed spectrum, elements for which target and source are the 
        same are not defined and these entries are populated with the 
        power spectrum for the associated region instead.
* `f` : ndarray, shape (n_frequencies)  
        Frequencies associated with axis 1 of ds_array.
* `groups` : ndarray of strings, shape (n_groups)  
        Names the channels/groups associated with ds_array.
